# PokerNowBasicStats
Simple R script written by a novice that produces three basic poker stats from a pokernow.club log file.
I wrote this script for a college project. 
This is the first R project I have written and I expect it will appear very rough to someone experienced in this language or programming more generally!
I run it in the free software RStudio which can be downloaded here https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/
I believe it correctly calculates the following three poker stats Voluntarty put into pot (VPIP), Pre-flop raise (PFR) and Agression Factor (AF).
If I get around to it I might add some more stats.
It is likely a little tempramental as I am no expert but please feel free to give it a go on your own pokernow.club log files as the results can be interesting!
